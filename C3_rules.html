        <h4>Section 3: Team Challenge</h4>
            <h3>3.1 Team Selection</h3>
            <p>At the beginning of the challenge, randomly selected teams of four or five will be revealed.

Requests for certain students to be placed on the same team shall not be granted.</p>
            <h3>3.2 Format</h3>
            <p>This challenge will ask teams to construct a website to fulfill a specific purpose, including a list of optional features for implementation. The students will receive two hours to complete the website and as many features as possible. Then, after a one-hour lunch break, students will present their websites in a randomized order. The website and presentation will be scored separately.</p>
            <p>The website will be scored based on the number of features implemented and the number of errors. </p>
            <p>The presentation will be scored based on the students’ skill in presenting and selling their item to the judges.</p>
            <h3>3.3 Materials</h3>
