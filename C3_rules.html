        <h4>Section 3: Team Challenge</h4>
            <h3>3.1 Team Selection</h3>
            <p>At the beginning of the challenge, randomly selected teams of four or five will be revealed.

The students will receive two hours to complete the website and as many features as possible. Then, after a one-hour lunch break, students will present their websites in a randomized order. The website and presentation will be scored separately.</p>
            <p>The website will be scored based on the number of features implemented and the number of errors. </p>
            <p>The presentation will be scored based on the studentsâ€™ skill in presenting and selling their item to the judges.</p>
            <h3>3.3 Materials</h3>
